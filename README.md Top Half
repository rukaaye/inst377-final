## Project Description
**Problem Statement:** Ensuring a balanced, varied diet can be challenging, especially for individuals with specific dietary needs like vegetarians and vegans. Traditional meal planning and grocery shopping often do not cater to these unique dietary requirements effectively.

**Solution:** Food4U is a web-based application designed to simplify meal planning and grocery shopping by providing personalized recipe suggestions and nutritional information. Leveraging the Edamam API, Food4U tailors recipes to user preferences and dietary restrictions, enriching the eating habits of its users.
